# Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, and PaLM have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation. Understanding how LLMs work — and how to build, fine-tune, or use them — is key to modern AI engineering.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the architecture and training paradigm behind transformer-based LLMs
- Use LLM APIs and open-source models for various tasks (chatbots, summarization, Q&A)
- Evaluate, fine-tune, and deploy LLMs in production settings
- Understand ethical and safety considerations when using LLMs

## Why It’s Important

LLMs are at the core of modern AI applications. They enable capabilities from code generation to legal research, medical summarization, and AI agents. Engineers with LLM fluency are in high demand across industries.
