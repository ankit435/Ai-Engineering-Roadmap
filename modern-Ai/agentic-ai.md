# Agentic AI

Agentic AI refers to systems that operate autonomously, making decisions and taking actions toward goals without constant human supervision. This is a core area of modern AI, where models like LLMs are embedded within agents that can plan, reason, and interact with tools and environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand what AI agents are and how they differ from single-shot LLM usage
- Build agents that can use tools, retrieve data, and complete tasks across steps
- Understand frameworks like LangChain, Auto-GPT, and CrewAI
- Design multi-agent systems and task orchestration flows

## Why It’s Important

Agentic systems are key to making LLMs actually *useful* in real-world applications — from autonomous research assistants to customer service bots and AI co-pilots. They unlock continuous reasoning, memory, planning, and decision-making.
