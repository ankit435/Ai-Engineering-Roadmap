# Reinforcement Learning (RL) for AI Engineering

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a paradigm of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It powers breakthroughs in robotics, gaming (AlphaGo), recommendation systems, and autonomous systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of RL, including agents, environments, rewards, and policies
- Implement value-based and policy-based methods (Q-learning, REINFORCE)
- Work with frameworks like OpenAI Gym and Stable Baselines
- Apply RL to real-world problems and environments

## Why It’s Important

RL is foundational for building AI agents that learn via trial and error — from self-driving cars to game-playing bots. Mastering RL helps you build autonomous systems that adapt and optimize their behavior in dynamic environments.
